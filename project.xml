[h1]Design Goals[/h1]
- Increase the number of viable playstyles for each class
- Ensure that no class is consistently outshined by any other
- Deliver mechanically on the promise of the original art &amp; character designs
- In general, simplify skills &amp; tooltips
- Ensure that remaining effects are impactful, both in terms of feel and in how they affect your decisions

[h1]Design Principles[/h1]
[b]Guild Description[/b]: The guild description was respected as the hero’s “blueprint”. These have not been changed, and still apply to the modded version of the hero in all cases.

[b]Minimal Lost Utility[/b]: Strategies that were effective in the base game should not be rendered useless or unplayable, only the most powerful have been slightly reduced in effectiveness. The exception to this rule is “boss cheese” strategies such as Rallying Flare vs the Swine Prince.

[b]Trinket Usage[/b]: This mod does not change trinkets, so heroes must still make effective use of all of their unmodded trinkets.

[h1]Changelog[/h1]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod uses the .art and .info files for the heroes it modifies, as well as the base camping skills file and the base provisions file. If another mod uses these files, there will be conflicts. Also, full overhauls such as Pitch Black Dungeon that rely on changes being made to every hero will have severe balance issues if used with this mod. If your mod doesn’t fall into either of these categories then congratulations, it’s compatible!

[h1]Localization[/h1]
Some minimal effort has been expended to make the mod playable in non-English languages, however only English has been thoroughly tested, and in other languages you will encounter English strings and possibly some very long/cut off tooltips. Please contact me if you are willing to translate this mod into another language!

[h1]Thanks[/h1]
Thanks to Clair de Lune, Chogex, O’Nightmare!, Sasiji, and Tilted Hat for helping me with questions in the Moonlit Dungeon Discord. Thanks to Red Hook Studios for making such a great &amp; moddable game!
