[b]Gyll’s Vanilla: Heroes[/b] redesigns or rebalances all 15 original hero classes. [i]Flagellant &amp; Shieldbreaker redesigns are in the works and will be released as separate mods when ready.[/i]

[h1][b]Design Goals[/b][/h1]
- Increase the number of viable skill builds for each class
- Ensure that no class is consistently outshined by any other
- Deliver mechanically on the promise of the original art &amp; character designs
- In general, simplify skills &amp; tooltips
- Ensure that remaining effects are impactful, both in terms of feel and in how they affect your decisions

[h1][b]About Gyll’s Vanilla[/b][/h1]

These mods are balanced against the vanilla base game and designed for maximum compatibility, creating a solid foundation for your modded campaigns.
